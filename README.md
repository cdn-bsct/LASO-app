#### LASO is a mobile language arts study application for people who are on the go and need to review. The idea is to have a simple, no frills, design focused on the content for review. 

It allows users to create their own custom inputs and store that information in a custom deck. Each custom deck is specific to the user.

The design is simple. I decided to take a colourful palette related to a [Japanese colour palette](https://www.schemecolor.com/love-in-japan-color-scheme.php), since the language of this application is japanese. 

I definitely focused on a more responsive application this time.

## **Data used for LASO application:**

I wrote my own data out to be used for the different cards to be shown.

I used one object template and put different types so that I would be able to differentiate between the different decks within this one massive deck.
